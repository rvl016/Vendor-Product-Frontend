# Vendor-Product Front-end

## How to Use

The app has a basic control panel at botton left, where you can create, modify and delete entries of vendors or vendor's products. 

In homepage (`Vendors View`), you can select multiple vendors on the table's checkboxes. Checking one, and only one vendor, unlocks the `MODIFY` button. Checking one or more vendors unlocks the `DELETE` button.

You can access each vendor's products by clicking on the respective table row, this will lead you to the vendor's producs page. In this page the behavior for the control panel is the same as in the `Vendors View` page.

## Running 

Just type `yarn start` on terminal at project's root directory.
